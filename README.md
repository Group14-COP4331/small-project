# small-project
This is your team's small project, Please note that all members must submit the PowerPoint presentation BEFORE their presentation. The due date in the webcourse for the assignment is 9-28-2021, but your due date is based on your presentation date. You must submit your PowerPoint slides before your presentation.

You have 12 minutes. Make sure your team practices the presentation. <-- Make sure

Your team's list and presentation time can be found at the google sheet here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bN6wqCls1fiF1NAbrdcq9bVjSfFRDhfG5NCDGLQE1p0/edit#gid=0 (Links to an external site.). You will need a project title, your GitHub link, and an application link. The presentation time will be assigned.

The small project presentations will be 12 minutes. Attendance for all presentations is mandatory. Immediately in advance of your presentation you DO NOT have time to go the google drive, drop box, or the like and retrieve your material. You should have your slides and support material on a USB stick or already on your computer. All members must participate in the presentation and be present, not just a hello, but take an aspect of the project to explain.

You may not show the web app from a local instance--it must be on a remote server.

You are also required to use a remote hosting service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, GoDaddy, AWS, or Azure. I will be demonstrating the LAMP stack using Digital Ocean. You must access your app with a domain name rather than an IP address.

The slides must be professional and start with a title page followed by a members page. Then you should explain what the project is, how it was developed, and anything that you feel is important. Gantt chart, UML and/or ER diagrams are required. Talk about what went well and what did not go well. Give a demo of the application. Leave time for questions and have a questions page.

Project Requirements:
Remote database
Use a LAMP stack. (Please do not use any Python-based framework)
Use JSON to communicate between client and server. During the presentation, you must show access to at least one API endpoint using SwaggerHub.
You will use a web page as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled that accesses the API.)

The program is a personal contact manager. Each user needs a login. If someone does not have an account, you need to offer a registration/signup mechanism. For each user, they can add their own contacts (not shared contacts). They can search for, edit, and delete contacts. When the initial page appears, users can either log in or sign up (register).

Please note: you must have a search API and not cache all contacts client side.

The user interface should be clean and professional. The project should be as professional as possible. The source and support files must be in github (You will add the link to the sign up sheet).

Deliverables:
Unzipped PowerPoint presentation -- (all members must submit before the presentation) First, make sure you put your GitHub and application links into the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bN6wqCls1fiF1NAbrdcq9bVjSfFRDhfG5NCDGLQE1p0/edit#gid=0 (Links to an external site.) 

You will get a zero if you miss your team's presentation without prior approval of the instructor.
